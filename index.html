<p>Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am a software developer living originally from Costa Rica ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡· living in Berlin, Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª. For the past 6 years I have been mostly focused on mobile development working in iOS, Android platforms and high performing teams.
<p>I have a passion for building things, when I am not working daily projects, I enjoy working and contributing to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio/">open source projects</a>, building things with my hands, or <a href="{{ site.photo_site }}">with my camera.</a></p>
