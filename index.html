<p>Hi 👋, I am a software developer living in Berlin Germany 🇩🇪, originally from Costa Rica 🇨🇷. For the past 7 years I have been mostly focused on mobile development working in iOS and Android platforms and leading high performing teams.
<p>I have a passion for building things, when I am not working in daily projects, I enjoy working and contributing to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio/">open source projects</a>, building things with my hands, or <a href="{{ site.photo_site }}">with my camera.</a></p>
<hr>
<p>In this website you can take a look at my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/resume/">Resume</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio/">Portfolio</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/opensource/">Open Source projects</a> and the slides and videos of my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/talks/">Talks</a></p>
