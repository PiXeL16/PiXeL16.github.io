<p>Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am a sofware developer living in San Jose, Costa Rica. For the past 4 years I have been mostly focused on mobile development working in iOS and Android platforms.
<p>I have a passion for building things, when I am not working in client projects, I like working and contributing to <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}">open source projects</a>, building things with my hands, or <a href="{{ site.photo_site }}">with my camera.</a></p>
