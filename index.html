<p>Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am a sofware developer living in San Jose, Costa Rica. For the past 4 years I have been mostly focused on mobile development working in iOS and Android platforms.
<p>I have a passion for building things, when I am not working in client projects, I enjoy working and contributing to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio/">open source projects</a>, building things with my hands, or <a href="{{ site.photo_site }}">with my camera.</a></p>
<hr>
<p>In this website you can take a look at my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/resume/">Resume</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio/">Portfolio</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/opensource/">Open Source projects</a>.</p>
